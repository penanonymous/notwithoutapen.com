Hi,

I know. This is pathetic. I'm pathetic. I am writing to you like we have a history. Like we were never just two people who worked together. Like you were once mine and I was yours.

I don't know why I chose this song. This is not some-never-heard-of-indie-heart-break song. A song that is too deep, it will make anyone cry not. For some reason, when I was listening to this song, I felt really motivated to write. I wanted a song that will best describe how I felt when I first met you. Well, this is not it. I haven't found that song yet but I felt that I should give merit to this song. This kind of reminded me of how I felt the first time we worked together.

> *I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet*    
> *And with this feeling I forget, I'm in love now*

I guess I can somehow say that everything made sense that day.

> *Someday, someone will come along and you will realize why it never worked out with anyone else*

And that day was that *someday* for me.

Love Always,    
Me
