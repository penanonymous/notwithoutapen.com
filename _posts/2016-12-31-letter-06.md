Hi,

How are you? No more messages huh? Is it because my phone lost service last time? Is it because of what I said? That I am lazier than ever? If that's the case then you're not going to like what I'm going to say next. I've lost all my ambitions and goals.

I am miserable. I know. If I were you, I'm not going to like myself too. I keep praying and praying. I prayed you'd send me a message on my birthday. And you did. Exactly at midnight. And that really made my day. Thank you. God has always been so good to me. I know surrendering you to him is not a bad idea. I can't help but to always ask this question though,

I guess someday we'll know. Someday I'll know.

Love always,    
Me
