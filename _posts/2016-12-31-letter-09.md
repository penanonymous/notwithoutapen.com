Hi,

Whenever I think about how we can't be together. I always end up thinking, "right, you already have a 'boyfie'". What would I give to be in his position right now? I always think, he's a douchebag. I hope but I know he isn't. He's probably really nice to think that he waited for you for a long time. He's perfect, you're lucky. You have his heart and mine.

He's your douchebag and he's probably going to get mad if he knew that I'm in love with you. You know what I don't understand? You told me you are gay and you are not so enthused whenever he calls you. Are you guys only a setup? Is it a Chinese thing? What would I give to be in his position right now?

Love always,    
Me
