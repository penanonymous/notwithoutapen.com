Hi,

It's been awhile since my last letter. I know. I even forgotten how this goes. I admit, for awhile, I forgot about you. Been pretty busy at work lately. I remembered last year when we're both obsessed with conversion rate and traffic. Well, this year is no different. Except I don't have you anymore this year to obsessed with. Damn. I miss you so much.

Is this it? The beginning of "get over it"? What can I do if you want to go. I can't control you. And I don't want to even if I can. You'll probably hate me even more. Actually, hate is better than ignored which is what you're doing to me now, but I'll save that for another letter.

Love always,    
Me
