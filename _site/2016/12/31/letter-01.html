              <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I know. This is pathetic. I’m pathetic. I am writing to you like we have a history. Like we were never just two people who worked together. Like you were once mine and I was yours.</p>

<p>I don’t know why I chose this song. This is not some-never-heard-of-indie-heart-break song. A song that is too deep, it will make anyone cry not. For some reason, when I was listening to this song, I felt really motivated to write. I wanted a song that will best describe how I felt when I first met you. Well, this is not it. I haven’t found that song yet but I felt that I should give merit to this song. This kind of reminded me of how I felt the first time we worked together.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I’m falling for your eyes, but they don’t know me yet</em>  <br />
<em>And with this feeling I forget, I’m in love now</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess I can somehow say that everything made sense that day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Someday, someone will come along and you will realize why it never worked out with anyone else</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that day was that <em>someday</em> for me.</p>

<p>Love Always,  <br />
Me</p>
