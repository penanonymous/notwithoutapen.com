              <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Today I woke up feeling miserable. Like most of my mornings before. This has became my routine now. I wake up. I go to the bathroom. I cry. I stop and go back to bed and then sleep again until I wake up to realize that yeah I have work. Life must still go on. It doesn’t stop because I am standing still. It doesn’t stop for me. It doesn’t work that way. I have to go to work. My favorite part of the day is when I go outside, sit on a park bench and write you a letter.</p>

<p>It’s killing me. I’m not blaming you. I just want to be honest. I know you get pissed off when I tell you only some parts of the truth. Like the day when I told you I’m not feeling well and then you found out that I’m only faking it because I don’t want to attend our Christmas party. Yeah, you we’re not happy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>If it’s only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?</em></p>

<p>I know it’s wrong but I wish I just died. There’s nothing left for me here. I will not love anyone else.</p>

<p>Love always, <br />
Me</p>
