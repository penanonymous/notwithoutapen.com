              <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Two days ago, the office had a party for two of your best friends. It’s their going away party. It made me think about your last day at the office. Finally, I was able to pick the best song to describe it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>And I don’t want you to leave, will you hold my hand?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, I’ve been listening to a lot of Sam Smith lately. He gets me. He gets how I feel. He said he loved but he was not loved back.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Why am I so emotional?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am so afraid to lose you and you’re not even mine to begin with. I can’t help but think that this is all my fault in the end. I kept on giving you stuff, my heart included, when I’m clearly not sure if you wanted it in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>And deep down I know this never works</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did I drive you away? Did I try too much? I tried to take care of you. I gave you an extension cord to make your desk more convenient but you stayed in the other room until your last day at work.</p>

<p>Did I try too little? I know I have the tendency to not show how much I care. I kept on hiding. To be honest, it kills me that I have to hide because no one will understand. No one cares. It also makes me sad because sometimes I feel like you’re one of the people who don’t care. It kills me that I have to keep quiet when all I want is to tell everyone that I love you. I love you.</p>

<p>Love always,  <br />
Me</p>
