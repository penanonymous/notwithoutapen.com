  <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Nothing. I just remembered you. You were in my dreams again last night. Probably because it’s the season again. Christmas lights are everywhere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>When you’re still waiting for the snow to fall,</em>  <br />
<em>it doesn’t really feel like Christmas at all.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can’t believe it’s already been a year since that time when you told me this is the season that you love the most. You told me how you love the lights and the mood. I remembered I told you mine was the ‘after’. When the lights are all back in the box but the days are still cold and the nights are still long. Gloomy.</p>

<p>I guess I was never really meant for a happy ending. I still wish I can have “Happy lang, walang ending” moment with you. I miss you.</p>

<p>Love always,  <br />
Me</p>
