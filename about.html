    <p>Hi,</p>

    <p>
      I remembered that last time I wrote you a letter. I thought it was
      sentimental and melodramatic but you thought it was "cheesy"
      and you're right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Well, these are words that revolves around that category.
      You're going to hate this, I know, but these are words I
      wrote after you left.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's the short version,
      <br/>
      I listened.
      <br/>
      I wrote.
      <br/>
      I sketched.
      <br/>
      I am never not thinking of you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open when you find this.
    </p>

    <p>I love you. I miss you.</p>

    <p>
      Love always,
      <br/>
      Me
